# Phyphox Connection

## Overview
Phyphox Connection is a Python library designed to interface with the Phyphox app, allowing users to collect and analyze data from smartphone sensors. This project provides tools to establish a connection, collect data in real time, and utilize various filters and processing functions.

## Features
- Real-time data collection from Phyphox enabled smartphone sensors.
- Data analysis and visualization using Python.
- Examples included for velocity graphs and seismic exploration.

## Installation
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/FeRsOmBrA/Phyphox-connection.git>
cd Phyphox-connection
# It's recommended to use a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Desktop App

I also created a friendly Desktop App for use this library, you can do the following:

- Start/Stop data collection from several devices running Phyphox.
- Configure and apply ML filters to analyze the collected data.
- Export data to different formats for further analysis in other applications or systems.

After cloning the repository, simply run this:

```bash
python phyphox_connection.py
```
