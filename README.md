# Phyphox Connection 

Hello, this is a very interesting project that is currently in progress, you can learn a little about this by looking at this webpage. https://phyphoxconnection.000webhostapp.com/

 Sorry for any issues opening the webpage, is already managed by 00webhostapp.com which is a free hosting service and doesn't have enabled any secure parameter, obviously a promise you that is secure because our project is for educational purposes only.
